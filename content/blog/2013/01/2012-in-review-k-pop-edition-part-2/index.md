The men have been [listed, ordered and critiqued]({{< ref "blog/2013/01/2012-in-review-k-pop-edition-part-1" >}}), now let's get on to part 2 of my 2012, K-Pop year in review.

## Female Artists

### 5. RAINBOW - A (Japanese Version)

RAINBOW have yet to release the Japanese Music Video for A digitally so above is a live performance of the Japanese Version
{{< /alert >}}

Unfortunately the ladies haven't held their end of the bargain in 2012 and this is a real sneaky entry. **RAINBOW** actually debuted **A** in 2010, only after two years of focusing on South Korea did they debut into the elusive (and cashed up) Japanese market. **A** was a fun and bouncy number which lost none of its energy in its transmutation from Korean to Japanese. Their coordinated dance choreography will excite even the most jaded K-Popper.

### 4. 4minute - Volume Up

{{< youtube qsWl1--Niyg >}}

Dat saxophone. I have no idea where they sampled it from but **4minute** has one sweet sax interlude which accompanies this powerful and shouty track that marked **4minute**'s comeback in 2012.  You might fail to realise Hyuna of (now) Gangnam Style fame is amongst the ladies that are pleading with the listener to indeed, turn the **Volume Up**. She is kept quite in check and out shined by the vocal talent of the other members who stretch out wails and pump melodies throughout.

### 3. miss A - Touch

{{< youtube aF8Fst_zonU >}}

Gentle, delicate; Touch makes you really feel the pain and sorrow that the 4 members of **miss A** are conveying. This soft and precious number mixes up short synth injections, a slow beat and the occasional rap to tug at the heart-strings.

### 2. SISTAR - Alone

{{< youtube E0ZHXVp_wUE >}}

Simplistic piano keys, soulful bass and husky voices make up **Alone**, **SISTAR**'s star attraction from their latest album of the same name. Where as miss A's touch was all heart, **Alone** is straight up sex appeal _(just check that porno wah pedal action)_ which is not necessarily a bad thing when you can do it well.

### 1. f(x) - Electric Shock

{{< youtube n8I8QGFA1oM >}}

Often over shadowed by their label mates Girls Generation, **f(x)** bring to the table a punchy electro pop smash hit that is super catchy without being too repetitive. Breaking up the funky dance melody is smooth vocal segments that focus the talent _(if not a little autotuned)_ of the 5 members and let them shine without being drowned out by the backbeat.

## Special Mentions

### Orange Caramel - Lipstick

{{< youtube 0Z9R57maGvc >}}

Kooky, Strange, Weird, a little bit spanish but a whole lot of fun; **Orange Caramel** (subunit of Afterschool) specialise in the category of bizarre pop but its all in the name of a good time. Watch and listen without your preduce and you may find yourself bopping to the beat.

### Girls Generation - Paparazzi

{{< youtube IUqP1xzRZkw >}}

While I [adore **Girls Generation**](http://dxpetti.com/blog/?p=160 "Girls’ Generation debut on American TV") as my gateway drug into the world of K-Pop, I didn't have the heart to put **Paparazzi** in the top 5 purely because it's essentially a modern-day version of their smash hit [Genie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwiSpudKWI "Girls' Generation(소녀시대) _ Genie(소원을말해봐) _ MusicVideo"). And while that isn't a bad thing (I love that song to bits), I prefer to reward innovation rather than cookie cutting for the sake of the dollar dollar.

That's it ladies and gentlemen. 2012 K-Pop in a snapshot. Hope you have enjoyed my take on the year. Please feel free to comment and add your thoughts at the bottom of the page.

Lets finish of with a creation by the ever talented [DJ Masa](http://www.masamixes.com "DJ Masa") featuring 75 songs of 2012.
