After all the huff and puff from [yesterdays media event](http://dxpetti.com/blog/?p=732 "Windows 9 is dead, long live Windows 10"), Microsoft have kept their word and made the Windows 10 Technical Preview available to anyone willing.

How do you get it?

1. Go to [http://insider.windows.com/](http://insider.windows.com/ "Windows Insider Program") and register for the Insider program
2. Go to [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/preview-download?ocid=tp\_site\_downloadpage](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/preview-download?ocid=tp_site_downloadpage "Download Windows Technical Preview") and download the flavour of Windows 10 Technical Preview you are after

Too easy
