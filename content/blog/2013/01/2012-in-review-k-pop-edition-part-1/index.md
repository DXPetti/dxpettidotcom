2012 was a pretty big year for K-Pop, we saw solid entries from staple groups like BIG BANG, SHINee and miss A, successful debuts from EXO-K/M, B.A.P and Block B and it even made the world stage with the man whom you are probably already aware of in PSY.

I'm going to break down what I thought was the best 5 from each side of the fence from the year and a few worthy mentions.

## Male Artists

### 5. B.A.P - Warrior

{{< youtube 5tLooPlf2Sw >}}

**B.A.P** _(which stands for Best Absolute Perfect)_ is a 6 member group now synominis with two things, bleach blonde hair and powerful rap. Nothing displays this love of hair product and shouty vocals like **Warrior**. Whenever I listen to this song I cannot help but follow along with the HOO's at each segment; certainly a song to pump you up for a session in the gym or a solid run. Must be the testosterone.

### 4. TVXQ - Catch Me

{{< youtube PfUlE2LlGro >}}

Now veterans of arguably the biggest powerhouse in K-Pop, SM Entertainment; **TVXQ** returned with this catchy (see what I did there)  track that features an almost egyptian come synth tune paired with a house beat that could see it slot directly on to any DJ's track list in a Western Club. And while it does make use of the dreaded dubstep, it is done so in a limited and tasteful way as such I can forgive the (self?) proclaimed kings of K-Pop.

### 3. SHINee - Sherlock

_wubwubwubwubwubwub SHINee's back wubwubwubwubwubwub_. It seems while you can escape Western pop's traditional antics you cannot escape dubstep (much to my dismay). Thankfully it is combined together with pitch perfect vocals, a little rap and more synth noises than a trip back to the 80s. Weird combination, yes but it does work. This unholy mix session is due to **Sherlock** actually the end product of two different songs coming together in unison, the dubstep/rap number **Clue** and the snare drum/synth overload track **Note**. I guess some opposites can make a whole...

### 2. EXO - History

{{< youtube vdejiaoEhFc >}}

It took a lot of will power not for this to be number 1 but **EXO**, who debuted after twenty billion teaser trailers (I gave up after number 5) with **MAMA**, blew me out of the park. I didn't think it would be possible for debut group to have such a diverse but consistently high quality selection of tracks on an album much less one from a group that is divided in two in an effort to conquer both Korean and Chinese markets. Ambitious but they have done something special.

**History** is a rather simple song; the tribal soundtrack and occasional pop of electro playing second fiddle to the showcase of strong Korean or Mandarin voices that display a good range and variety.

### 1. BIG BANG - Fantastic Baby

{{< youtube AAbokV76tkU >}}

Despite being the 3rd released single of their album entitled **ALIVE**, the highly charged fun dance number **Fantastic Baby** has fast become the favourite among fans and myself. Designed to do one thing and one thing only, **Fantastic Baby** will get you out of your chair and trying your latest dance before you can say "Boom Shak-a-lak-a!" Switch on and get moving!

## Special Mentions

### Block B - Nillili Mambo

{{< youtube 4AYJZvHeKFo >}}

Debuting around the same time as B.A.P and featuring men of similar testosterone-fueled nature, **Block B** is just as outlandish with a good mix of varying hip hop and steady beats (not to mention how silly their music video is).

### LEDApple - Time Is Up

{{< youtube k6m4bVl_wxY >}}

I was never a fan of the instrumental K-Pop groups masquerading as bands (CNBlue was the low point for me at the [2011 K-Pop Music Fest in Sydney](https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/288068_250425818331666_7843766_o.jpg "2011 K-Pop Music Fest in Sydney poster")) but credit where credit is due, **LEDApple**'s **Time Is Up** is a catchy song that will grow on you. Doesn't hurt one of the members is actually Australian

### PSY - Gangnam Style

{{< youtube 9bZkp7q19f0 >}}

I don't think this one needs explaining but **Gangnam Style**, designed as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on the province of the same name in South Korea where by the ladies dress to a high fashion standard during the day and let their hair down come the cover of nightfall has taken the world by storm. Why? Tough to say. Having a combination of easy to remember key lyrics, catchy beat and ridiculous dance moves helps; ultimately, I think the song expresses best what **PSY** wanted from the song; pure, simple, no-nonsense fun. _Oppa Gangname Style_
