Windows 8.1 has been available for sometime to those who have access to a TechNet/MSDN account but today is the day of its general release.

If you already have Windows 8 on your PC, head to the **Store** app in your Start Menu and click the big picture inviting you to update to Windows 8.1 for free. After that it is a simple matter of hitting **Download** and you are on your way.

The download comes in at 3.1 GB so its a little bit larger than your average app update ;)

Update and enjoy
