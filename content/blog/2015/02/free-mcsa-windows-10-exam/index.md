Microsoft have a pretty great deal currently going for anyone who earns themselves the title of MCSA Windows 8 during the dates of February 15th and May 31st will receive a free attempt at the MCSA Windows 10 exam (precisely, exam 697) when it arrives.

So if you are currently a MCSA Windows 7 or even MCSA Windows XP then now is a better time than ever to upgrade your skills or, if you haven't dipped your toes into Windows certification then where better to start than the client-facing side certificates.
